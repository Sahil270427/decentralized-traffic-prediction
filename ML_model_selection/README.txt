# ML_Model_Selection.ipynb

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the process of selecting and evaluating various machine learning models for regression tasks. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison.

## Prerequisites

Before running this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages (listed in the `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

Install the required packages:
   You can install the required Python packages by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, install packages manually:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost tensorflow keras psutil
   ```

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   This command will open Jupyter in your default web browser.

2. Navigate to the Notebook:
   Once Jupyter is running, navigate to the directory containing `ML_model_selection.ipynb` and open it.

3. Run the Notebook:
   Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially by selecting the cell and clicking the "Run" button, or by pressing `Shift + Enter`.

## Configuration

If there are any configuration options or hyperparameters that need to be set, you can do so by editing the appropriate cells in the notebook.

## Output

The notebook will generate various model performance metrics and plots that help in comparing the effectiveness of different machine learning models. You may also obtain trained model files if the notebook is configured to save them.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consider the following steps:

- Ensure all required Python packages are installed.
- Make sure your dataset is correctly formatted and available.
