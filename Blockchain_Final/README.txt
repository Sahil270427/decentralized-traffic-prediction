# Blockchain_Final.ipynb

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook explores blockchain-related data and performs various tasks such as data processing, model training, and blockchain interaction using Python. The notebook includes the use of machine learning models, web3 interactions, and data visualization.

## Prerequisites

Before running this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages (listed in the `requirements.txt`)
- Node.js and npm (for blockchain tools like Ganache, Truffle, and Solidity)

## Installation

### Python Dependencies

   Install the required Python packages:
   You can install the required Python packages by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, install packages manually:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn web3 psutil requests numpy pytz
   ```

### Blockchain Tools

1. Install Ganache:
   ```bash
   npm install -g ganache-cli
   ```

   Or download the Ganache desktop application from [Ganache's official website](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/).

2. Install Truffle:
   ```bash
   npm install -g truffle
   ```

3. Install the Solidity compiler:
   ```bash
   npm install -g solc
   ```

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Start the Ganache server on port 8545:
   ```bash
   ganache-cli -p 8545
   ```

2. Deploy the smart contracts using Truffle:
   Navigate to the directory containing your Truffle project and run:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate
   ```
   This will deploy your smart contracts to the local Ganache blockchain.

3. Update the contract address in the notebook:
   After deploying the contracts, copy the contract address and update the relevant sections of the notebook code with this address.

4. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   This command will open Jupyter in your default web browser.

5. Navigate to the Notebook:
   Once Jupyter is running, navigate to the directory containing `Blockchain_Final.ipynb` and open it.

6. Run the Notebook:
   Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially by selecting the cell and clicking the "Run" button, or by pressing `Shift + Enter`.

## Configuration

If there are any configuration options or parameters that need to be set, you can do so by editing the appropriate cells in the notebook. Ensure that your local blockchain network (Ganache) is running on port 8545 if the notebook requires blockchain interaction.

## Output

The notebook will generate various outputs, including model performance metrics, blockchain transaction details, and data visualizations.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consider the following steps:

- Ensure all required Python packages are installed.
- Make sure Ganache is running on port 8545 if the notebook interacts with a blockchain.
- Verify that the contract address in the notebook matches the one deployed by Truffle.
- Refer to the error messages in the notebook for guidance on what might be wrong.
