# Data_Preprocessing.ipynb

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates various data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and other essential steps before feeding the data into machine learning models.

## Prerequisites

Before running this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages (listed in the `requirements.txt`)

## Installation
Install the required packages:
   You can install the required Python packages by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, install packages manually:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn psutil
   ```

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   This command will open Jupyter in your default web browser.

2. Navigate to the Notebook:
   Once Jupyter is running, navigate to the directory containing `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb` and open it.

3. Run the Notebook:
   Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially by selecting the cell and clicking the "Run" button, or by pressing `Shift + Enter`.

## Configuration

If there are any configuration options or parameters that need to be set, you can do so by editing the appropriate cells in the notebook.

## Output

The notebook will generate preprocessed datasets, summary statistics, and visualizations that aid in understanding the preprocessing steps. You may also obtain transformed datasets ready for modeling.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consider the following steps:

- Ensure all required Python packages are installed.
- Verify that your dataset is correctly formatted and available.
